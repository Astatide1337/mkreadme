## üöÄ Installation

Install `mkaireadme` directly from PyPI with a single command:

```bash
pip install mkaireadme
```

## üèÅ Getting Started

Get your first AI-generated README in just 3 simple steps.

### Step 1: Set Your API Key

The tool requires an API key from [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/keys) to function. Set it once, and it will be saved locally for all future use.

```bash
mkaireadme set-key YOUR_OPENROUTER_API_KEY```

### Step 2: Create a License (Recommended)

A `LICENSE` file is crucial for any serious project. `mkaireadme` can create one for you.

```bash
mkaireadme license
```
This will prompt you to choose from a list of popular open-source licenses.

### Step 3: Generate Your README!

Navigate to your project's root directory and run the `gen` command.

```bash
# Use the recommended Gemini Flash model
mkaireadme gen --model google/gemini-flash-1.5
```

That's it! Your new `README.md` is ready. To update it later after making changes to your project, just run the same command again.

## üìö Command Reference
